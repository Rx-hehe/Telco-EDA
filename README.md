# Telco-EDA

## Dataset
This project uses the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle*:

- Contains customer account information, subscription details, and churn status.
- Each row represents a single customer.
- Columns include numerical features (e.g., tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges) and categorical features (e.g., Contract type, Payment method, Churn).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The goal of this project is to perform EDA to understand:

1. What the data represents
2. Missing values or duplicate rows
3. Outliers and unusual distributions
4. Patterns and relationships between features
5. Which variables influence customer churn

## This Repository Includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook that loads the dataset and applies EDA techniques:
  - Data cleaning and type conversion
  - Univariate and bivariate analysis
  - Correlation matrix and visualizations
  - Time-based trends in customer activity
- The Telco Customer Churn dataset CSV used for the analysis
